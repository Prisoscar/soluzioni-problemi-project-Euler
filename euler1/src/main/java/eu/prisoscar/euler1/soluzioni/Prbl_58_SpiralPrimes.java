/*
Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

(37) 36  35 34 33 32 (31)
 38 (17) 16 15 14 (13) 30
39 18  (5)  4  (3) 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20  (7)  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
(43) 44 45 46 47 48 49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal,
but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
